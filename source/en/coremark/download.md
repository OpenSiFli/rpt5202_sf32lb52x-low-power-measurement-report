# Routine Compilation and Programming
## Compilation
If using pre-compiled image files, you can skip directly to the programming section to start testing.
Enter the example\pm\coremark\project\hcpu directory and execute
```
scons --board=sf32lb52-core_n16r16 -j8 
```
Compile and generate HCPU image file. The compiled image file is saved in the build directory.

```

```
to program the image file generated by compilation in the build directory.
