# âš¡ Processor Performance and Power Consumption Test

This chapter focuses on power consumption characteristics analysis of SF32LB52x processor under different computational loads, including standardized benchmark tests and basic loop tests.

## ðŸŽ¯ Test Objectives

Evaluate chip power consumption performance under different computational intensities through standardized processor tests:

- **Coremark Benchmark Test**: Industry-standard CPU performance benchmark test
- **While Loop Test**: Power consumption baseline test for basic loop operations  
- **Shutdown Mode Test**: Power consumption measurement in the lowest power state
